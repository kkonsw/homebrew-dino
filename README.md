### Brew formula for download and install fork of Dino+ Client (XMPP client).

----

For using this formula, follow next instructions:

```
brew tap marat-yusupov/homebrew-dino
brew install marat-yusupov/homebrew-dino/dino
```

You can start the Dino client with the following command:

```
./opt/homebrew/Cellar/dino/3/bin/dino
```

I recommend creating a shortcut with a symbolic link to this file so that you can open it in a way that is convenient for you.
