<b>Brew formula for download and install fork of Dino Client (XMPP client).</b> 
<hr>

For using this formula, follow next instructions:

<code>$ brew tap marat-yusupov/homebrew-dino</code>
<br>
<code>$ brew install marat-yusupov/homebrew-dino/dino</code>

You can start the Dino client with the following command:

<code>$ ./opt/homebrew/Cellar/dino/3/bin/dino</code>

I recommend creating a shortcut with a symbolic link to this file so that you can open it in a way that is convenient for you.
